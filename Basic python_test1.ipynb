    "1. What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
    "\n",
    "a)Python is a programming language that executes the code line by    line. It is also called as interpreted language.\n",
    "b) It is popular because of it's versatility, simplicity, extensive libraries and served as multi purpose language.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is an interpreter in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "An Interpreter in python is a program that executes or convertes the byte code into machine code lime by line. The process repeates for each line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are pre-defined keywords in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-defined keywords are reserved words that has specific usage. They have a fundamental building block of python syntax and structure.\n",
    "Example for, if, while are some keywords that does specific funtion.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Can keywords be used as variable name?\n",
    "\n",
    "Keywords cannot be used as variable names. It will throw a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutability in python refers to the object state in python is changed even after creating it. We will be able to modify the content if we wanted is called mutability. Example list is mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are mutable because their creators intended them to be dynamic collections where elements can be added, removed, or changed.\n",
    "Lists are dynamic.\n",
    "Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable by design. They are meant to be static, unchangeable sequences. Tuples are static.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "a)\"==\" (Equality operator): This operator checks if the values of two objects are equal. It compares the content of the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "b)\"is\" (Identity operator): This operator checks if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory. It compares their memory addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three logical operators in python, and, or, not.\n",
    "a) \"and\" returns \"True\" if both the conditions are true.\n",
    "b) \"or\" returns \"True\" if any of the condition is true.\n",
    "c) \"not\" returns \"True\" if the condition is false. Returns \"False\" if the condition is true.\n",
    "\r",
    "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type casting is converting one type of data into another type.\n",
    "Example, \n",
    "num = \"20\"\n",
    "print(int(num)+5)\n",
    "The output will be 25, the string data type is converted into interger.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit type casting is the type conversion done automatically by the python interpreter itself. Example when a input is got from the user using input() it is defaultly obtained in str() datatype.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit type casting, also known as typecasting, is when a programmer explicitly converts a variable's data type using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of your program. They allow us to execute a specific block of code only if a certain condition is met.\n",
    "The primary conditional statements in Python are if, elif, and else.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. How does the elif statement work ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The elif statement in Python is short for \"else if\" and is used to check for another condition if the preceding if or elif statements were all false. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter first checks the condition of the initial if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the if condition is True, its code block is executed, and the entire if...elif...else block is finished. The interpreter skips all subsequent elif and else checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the if condition is False, the interpreter moves on to the first elif statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If that elif condition is True, its code block is executed, and the chain is finished.\n",
    "example:\n",
    "\n",
    "score = 85\n",
    "\n",
    "if score >= 90:\n",
    "    print(\"A Grade\")\n",
    "elif score >= 80:\n",
    "    print(\"B Grade\")\n",
    "elif score >= 70:\n",
    "    print(\"C Grade\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Better luck next time.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The if condition (score >= 90) is False.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter then checks the first elif condition (score >= 80), which is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will be \"You got a B.\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter stops there and does not check the remaining elif or else statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n",
    "\n",
    "for loop is used when we know the number of iterations or want to process each valu in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "  print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition. The loop continues to run until the condition becomes false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "  print(count)\n",
    "  count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "A while loop is more suitable than a for loop in scenarios where the number of iterations is unknown and the loop needs to continue until a specific condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
